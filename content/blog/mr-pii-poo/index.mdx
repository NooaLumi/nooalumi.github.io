# Mr. Pii Poo

<pre className="poem">
Mr. Pii Poo
was a magician.
He shouted: _hii hoo_!
kicked the ground
<span className="poem__indent-1"></span>and conjured up:
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>bananas
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>broccolies
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>shallots
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>strawberries
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>peppers
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>princesses
<span className="poem__indent-2"></span>and shells,

so
Mr. Pii Poo
knew some spells.

Once
Mr. Pii Poo
visited Espa.
He shouted: _hii hoo_!
kicked the ground
and then with a vespa
he drove.

That was Mr. Pii Poo's
grave mistake.

See, a magician's ways
can't sway machines
not motors
not nuts
not bolts
not gears
not clutches

after all:
a machine has a machine's pace.

So then,
Mr. Pii Poo
drove home again.
He shouted: _hii hoo_!
kicked the vespa
and ran into an incoming train.

I'm dying,
screamed Mr. Pii Poo,
and my hair's not yet gray!
He shouted: _hii hoo_!
and died some other day.

— Herra Pii Poo, a poem by Kirsi Kunnas from Tiitiäisen satupuu (‘The Tittytumpkin’s fairy tree’, 1956)

This is a poem from my childhood that I always remember fondly. You should check out the [reading done by the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=P-CHVhVqBfw)—how dramatic! Such an emotional rollercoaster.

It also somewhat relates to my current occupation. You know the term 'Computer wizard'? I guess that's complete bogus, since as we now know, spells don't work on machines! 

The poem also packs in a lot of information for a child audience. Lists of fun words that kids can recognize and learn, fun imagery (princesses appearing out of nowhere and a wizard driving a scooter), as well as the all-important lesson that motor vehicles and trains are really dangerous! Even a wizard can get hurt!!

Rest in peace Kirsi Kunnas
