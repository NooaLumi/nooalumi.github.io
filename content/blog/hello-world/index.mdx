# Obligatory 'Hello World!' post

As expected, the moment I got this blog up-and-running I completely forgot what I even wanted to write about in the first place. 
I'm sure it'll come back to me, but in the meanwhile I might as well tell you about how I set this site up.

## The Alright Gatsby

I picked [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for its flexibility and familiarity (not with Gatsby itself, but with React and GraphQL). I briefly also considered [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but
then saw that it's built on Ruby. I'm not going to talk shit on something I've never tried, but I don't trust a language who's primary package manager
calls its packages RubyGems. I thought Rust was being cute with it's Cargo Crates, but this is next level.

I used the **Typescript** starter with some related plugins pre-installed, but no themes or templates. I couldn't find one I liked and assumed it wouldn't take too long
to slap some styles together. 

For CSS, I went with the [milligram](https://milligram.io/) stylesheet which I extended with my own colors and typography stuff. **CSS modules** came pre-installed, so I used those for all
stand-alone components. They're kind of a pain to use with typescript so I might install a CSS-in-JS library at some point instead.

These blog posts use [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/), which is just markdown with the option to embed JSX down the line if need be.

## Conclusion

Err.. that's about it. It took me some six hours total to set this up, so it definitely delivered on efficiency. I also like the whole `Local files -> GraphQL -> Build-time React props`
workflow that's going on. Makes things very flexible. 

I guess I'll also try to attach an image at the end here to see if that whole thing works. And maybe some code to check syntax highlighting as well.


```typescript
const sayHello: string = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

If this works, you should see the icon I made for this site blown up below. Fingers crossed!
