Here's my top 25 albums of all time as of 18.02.2025. I'll come back here to write about each of these when I get the chance.

### Unto Others - Mana 

[Mana](https://tidal.com/browse/album/157973177?u) is melancholic, but not rip-your-heart-out sad like _Katatonia_'s stuff. Like trying to capture the stars in your fist VS taking your fist to the floorboards.
It's wistful, but there's also plenty to smile about. I'd describe it as a fun record inspite of the often dark themes.

It's also not very heavy, borrowing more from gothic rock than metal. And holy mother of reverb! There's a lot of that.
Yelling at the void is what it feels like. The landscape is something like trees with dead branches lit by streetlights. I don't know.
My favorite song is _Don't Waste Your Time_. The lyrics are written in the second person, but it feels like you're admonishing yourself. Great stuff. 

Not a single skip on this one by the way, so don't. Best enjoyed late at night, 9⭐

### Katatonia - The Great Cold Distance

[The Great Cold Distance](https://tidal.com/browse/album/68048954?u) is the saddest album I've ever heard, in a good way. Absolutely emotionally crushing. 
The beautiful vocals are juxtaposed with this super heavy instrumentation. That's my preference: Let the bass, drums and guitar express the inner turmoil while the vocals put on a brave face. 

There's some strange time signatures and absolutely bangin' bass riffs. 
_Deliberation_ is my favorite track, but I prefer to play the whole record through when I'm in the mood. 
Mood's what it's all about. This is straight poison unless you're already down in the dumps. I warned you, 9⭐

### In Flames - Clayman

[Clayman](https://tidal.com/browse/album/130270645?u) is indignant and aggressive. Bitter and dripping with vitriol and bad faith. 
It's like putting a ball of yarn on the most aggressive wash cycle. Not only is nothing unravelled, it gets further tangled up. 
But damn does it feel cathartic seeing it bounce around like that. 

Delicious guitar riffs, some keyboards and effects too. Someone cooked during post-production. _Only for the Weak_ is the best song on here and there's a couple skips on the latter half. Sweden does it again, 9⭐

### The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced

I imagine [Are You Experienced](https://tidal.com/browse/album/3254525?u) is what people in the late sixties pulled out when their mates started talking about _Revolver_. To appear cooler, and they were. 

I'm saving the word stylish for Bowie so I think slick fits here. Effortlessly effective is a great definition. Man this is slick. 
Like winking at the cashier and getting one back. Don't do that, unless this is playing. 

The riffs are nuts and not just for the time. Got me reeling back like there's a headwind.
My favorite track is _Love Or Confusion_. It's always the latter, 9⭐

### Björk - Post

[Post](https://tidal.com/browse/album/341273465?u)... I don't buy those exotic looking fruit at the store. Not because I don't think they'd be delicious, but because I don't know where to start with them. 
Björk knows. She could peel some truly lovecraftian fruit if she wanted to.

Strange is often silly, and Post does get silly sometimes. But when it wants to, it can immerse you in some otherworldly scenery. Places you couldn't get
without the etheral vocals and bizarre samples. 

_Army Of Me_ is one of the best songs ever made, but this record is a whole magician's hatful of octarine-colored fireworks.
No equal to contest, 10⭐

### Sigh - Imaginary Sonicscape

[Imaginary Sonicscape](https://tidal.com/browse/album/52091368?u) is out to surprise and overwhelm. It's noisy, unrefined and overly dramatic.

I fuck heavy with this. If you took a stethoscope to my head you might hear _Corpsecry - Angelfall_, my favorite track. 

The tone is macabre, which meshes oddly well with the keyboards and every electronic sample you've ever heard. 
Combine these with great prog composition and play, and you've got something charismatic enough to make me blush. 9⭐


### Tool - Lateralus

People talk about how your life flashes before your eyes when you're dying. You pass on with moist eyes and a smile.

[Lateralus](https://tidal.com/browse/album/114330485?u) is here to remind you that reflection isn't always sweet. There is a strong existential undertone 
to the whole album, and it feels like it's actively trying to entrance you.

It also has some of the best bass and percussion I've ever heard. In terms of sheer sound, [Wildhoney](https://tidal.com/browse/album/84971523?u) still clears on drums (though _Reflection_ almost converted me), 
but for bass I can't recall anything that comes close. You can't not listen to the whole thing, but the title track is my personal favorite. 

Ponder your place in the cosmos, 10⭐

### Jack Stauber - Pop Food

Fuck you, this is my comfort album. You listen to embarrassing shit too. I smoke my stogie anywhere I want! I don't have to find a hideout place like you! [[*]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSjRt2AjmdA)

[Pop food](https://tidal.com/browse/album/72438595?u) is a befitting name and it's your loss if that has negative connotations for you. Full of lofi pop tunes crafted with pure love. _Dog Nightmare_ is my favorite. 

Treat yourself, 9⭐
