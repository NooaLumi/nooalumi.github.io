Here's my top 25 albums of all time (as of 18.02.2025 anyway). I could yap for hours about any one of these, but TLDR; these are all bangers across various genres. 
I'll come back here to write about these records when I feel like it.

### Unto Others - Mana 

[Mana](https://tidal.com/browse/album/157973177?u) is melancholic, but not rip-your-heart-out sad like _Katatonia_'s stuff. Like trying to capture the stars in your fist VS taking your fist to the floorboards.
It's wistful, but there's also plenty to smile about. I'd describe it as a fun record inspite of the often dark themes.

It's also not very heavy, borrowing more from gothic rock than metal. And holy mother of reverb! There's a lot of that.
Yelling at the void is what it feels like. The landscape is something like trees with dead branches lit by streetlights. I don't know.
My favorite song is _Don't Waste Your Time_. The lyrics are written in the second person, but it feels like you're admonishing yourself. Great stuff. 

Not a single skip on this one by the way, so don't. Best enjoyed late at night, 9‚≠ê

### Katatonia - The Great Cold Distance

[The Great Cold Distance](https://tidal.com/browse/album/68048954?u) is the saddest album I've ever heard, in a good way. Absolutely emotionally crushing. 
The beautiful vocals are juxtaposed with this super heavy instrumentation. That's my preference: Let the bass, drums and guitar express the inner turmoil while the vocals put on a brave face. 
Unlike _Brave Murder Day_ where all hell is let loose (that's good too).

There's some strange time signatures and absolutely bangin' bass riffs. 
_Deliberation_ is my favorite track, but I prefer to play the whole record through when I'm in the mood. 
Mood's what it's all about. This is straight poison unless you're already down in the dumps. I warned you, 9‚≠ê

### In Flames - Clayman

[Clayman](https://tidal.com/browse/album/130270645?u) is indignant and aggressive. Bitter and dripping with vitriol and bad faith. 
It's like putting a ball of yarn on the most aggressive wash cycle. Not only is nothing unravelled, it gets further tangled up. 
But damn does it feel cathartic seeing it bounce around like that. 

Delicious guitar riffs, some keyboards and effects too. Someone cooked during post-production. _Only for the Weak_ is the best song on here and there's a couple skips on the latter half. Sweden does it again, 9‚≠ê
