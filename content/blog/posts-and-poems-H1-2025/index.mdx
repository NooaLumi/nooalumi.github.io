# Posts and Poems of H1 of 2025

I write stuff all over the place so I thought I'd collect some here. 

## Wikipedia

I had a brief stint in the beginning of the year where I contributed to some veganism/vegetarianism -related pages on the Finnish wikipedia. I'm not sure how it happened, but 
pages on vegan proteins (nuts, seeds, soybeans, etc.) and many other foods often associated with a vegan diet were borderline vandalized and had been that way for a long time. 

Any mentions of positive health outcomes had been removed or downplayed, and even the slightest potential hazards were blown up to multiple paragraphs. Reading the ["Terveysvaikutukset" section of the 2024 version](https://fi.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soijapapu&oldid=22719023#Terveysvaikutukset) of the article on 
soybeans is hilarious. It starts by saying that soybeans contain Nickel, which is "bad for your health". If you didn't know, Nickel is a micronutrient **essential** for human life. It then goes on to say that eating soybeans increases risk of breast cancer, which 
was directly contradicted by the linked source. I'm not kidding: the section doesn't include mention of a single health benefit. 

This incensed me, since I could imagine some fifty-year-old alchoholic showing the page to his wife to convince her that the women's health magazine she read is totally stupid and wrong. 
So, I ended up going on a crusade to slash some of the more egregious stuff. It's more difficult to remove text on wikipedia than it is to add it, since you're essentially removing another contributor's work. 
I made sure to attach supporting evidence and arguments to all my edits, and luckily all of them were accepted. I even got a thank you on [my talk page](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keskustelu_k%C3%A4ytt%C3%A4j%C3%A4st%C3%A4:Nooa_Lumilaakso). Huge!

[Here's](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toiminnot:Muokkaukset/Nooa_Lumilaakso) the list of changes I made if you're interested.

Granted, things are only slightly better now. You can read the page [Lihan terveysvaikutukset](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lihan_terveysvaikutukset) and then the [equivalent section on the English-language wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#Health_effects) if you want to laugh really really hard. 

## Poems

I post poems sometimes on [AllPoetry](https://allpoetry.com/Warm_Snow). Here's two from this year:

<blockquote>

### [Dissonance](https://allpoetry.com/poem/18218416-Dissonance-by-Warm-Snow)
-Chilly-

You mistake subtlety for lack;
magnitude for depth.
A tree disappears beyond the mist
and you see only silhouette,
but feel no wind.

-Warm-

My affections twisted impotent.
Veiled in tiny thorns‚Äîa prickly kindness
with an honest fire kindling somewhere in-between,
but letting off no heat.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

### [Fanatic](https://allpoetry.com/poem/18412017-Fanatic-by-Warm-Snow)

Look up. Recognize: a watchful eye, a gaze. Look down. Find another‚Äîfiery and ablaze.  
  
Crown of bones to please your new Lord  
and a wand of sinew and flesh.  
Blood in a chalice, still warm from the vein.  
Infused upon His holy breath.  
  
Empty the thrones for the Lord who descends upon us.  
Present Him the bodies of sinners and hope it's enough.

</blockquote>

## Skeets

I don't really miss twitter, but I do want a place to post my jokes. Here's some bangers from my [BlueSky page](https://bsky.app/profile/warmsnowv.bsky.social):

## Notes graveyard

<blockquote>
Life comes at you at alternating paces. 
Sometimes it leads you by the nose, 
and others you must face it.
I prefer it much it tells me what to do and where to be.
I'm the sort that only works when duty calls for me.

Not much gets done when I'm the one who holds the horse's reins. 
The journey slows and slowly even sense of purpose wanes. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Your search for a great fate has brought you to this realm of chaos.
Your search has ended. Not in finding, but in being found. The forces that vie for control over the fragments of reality have sensed your thirst, and you've been invited to test your mettle.
In your arrogance you think they've recognized you, but many hundreds have walked the same road as you. The path is paved with their corpses. 
Your thirst remains, and your feet keep pace. The wick of fate crackles and pops.

<blockquote>
Ambition that makes your heart race. The kind that rises from the deepest pit of your stomach, up your throat and stops barely sealed by your pressed lips. 
A monsoon that cannot be dammed. A hail from which there is no shelter. Destiny has called and you're compelled by every fiber of your being to answer. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
If your parents loved you‚Äîread to you on nights when sleep was late to arrive‚Äîthen you've heard my name before. 
When a slave rebels against their master, or a child leaves their broken home, we say they've removed a hand from the whiskers to grab the mane. 
My home is the empire of Illian, its symbol is the lion, and if you ever find yourself gritting your teeth in injustice, speak my name to find your courage:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
You've caught me at a bad time. 
I'm sure yesterday I would have been a bright flame.
I'd cast a great shadow portrait of your form. 
But currently I'm in a stasis of sorts.
An indicisive, lethargic haze.
I know you won't wait until tomorrow, but if we meet again
I hope it's when I'm more determined.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
That's cool, but I would have...<br/>
How neat, but that's wrong...<br/>
‚Äîwhat say have you when you've done nothing at all?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
My respect is dispensed in moderate quantity.
The kind that isn't unyielding; unconditional. 
I can respect parts without the whole, 
because no other is born that I agree with fully. And that is good.
